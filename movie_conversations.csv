0,"Noah: Would you just stay with me? Stay with you? What for? Look at us, we're already fighting. 
Allie: Well, that's what we do. We fight... You tell me when I am being an arrogant son of a bitch and I tell you when you are a pain in the ass. Which you are, 99% of the time. I'm not afraid to hurt your feelings. You have like a 2-second rebound rate and then you're back doing the next pain-in-the-ass thing.

1,"Jacob: You're a great girl, and you deserve a great guy. Maybe I am a little bit of a... a sleazeball, a pervert, you know, whatever. But, uh, the thing is, you deserve a guy who can make you happy. And I'm just not that guy.
Hannah: You're not? You're not that guy?
Jacob: No. I mean, I'm not saying that I'm that guy. I'm just saying that... maybe we could be that guy together.

2,"Mr. Darcy: Miss Elizabeth. I have struggled in vain and I can bear it no longer. These past months have been a torment. I came to Rosings with the single object of seeing you... I had to see you. I have fought against my better judgment, my family's expectations, the inferiority of your birth, my rank and circumstance, all these things that I am willing to put aside and ask you to end my agony.
Elizabeth: I don't understand.
Mr. Darcy: I love you. Most ardently. Please do me the honor of accepting my hand.

4,"Harry: You realize of course that we could never be friends.
Sally: Why not?
Harry: What I'm saying is - and this is not a come-on in any way, shape or form - is that men and women can't be friends because the sex part always gets in the way.
Sally: That's not true. I have a number of men friends and there is no sex involved.
Harry: No you don't.
Sally: Yes I do.
Harry: No you don't.
Sally: Yes I do.
Harry: You only think you do.

Lara Jean: Then what didn't you finish?
Peter: This. (leans in for a kiss)

6,"Harry: You're the worst kind. You're high maintenance, but you think you're low maintenance.
Sally: I don't see that.
Harry: You don't see that? Waiter, I'll begin with a house salad, but I don't want the regular dressing. I'll have the balsamic vinegar and oil, but on the side. And then the salmon with the mustard sauce, but I want the mustard sauce on the side. 'On the side' is a very big thing for you.

7,"Peter: You were never second best.
Lara Jean: But you were.
Peter: Not even close. You were always my first choice.

12,"Chuckie: You're sittin' on a winning lottery ticket. You're too much of a pussy to cash it in, and that's bullshit. Cause I'd do fuckin' anything to have what you got. So would any of these fuckin' guys.
Will: It's not about that.
Chuckie: What's it about?
Will: I'm not afraid to take a swing at a guy if I have to.
Chuckie: Look, you're my best friend, so don't take this the wrong way. In 20 years, if you're still livin' here, comin' over to my house to watch the Patriots games, still workin' construction, I'll fuckin' kill ya. That's not a threat, that's a fact. I'll fuckin' kill ya.

13,"Sam: You can't just sit there and put everybody's lives ahead of yours and think that counts as love. You just can't. You have to do things.
Charlie: I am doing things. I'm being a participator. I'm not sitting on the sidelines watching my own life go by.
Sam: No. You're being a spectator. You're a wallflower. You see things. You keep quiet about them. And you understand.
Charlie: I don't want to be a wallflower anymore.
Sam: Well, then be a freak. Be who you are. You know? Because you're going to be a whole lot happier if you are.

14,"Brian: Dear Mr. Vernon: We accept the fact that we had to sacrifice a whole Saturday in detention for whatever it was we did wrong, but we think you're crazy for making us write an essay telling you who we think we are. You see us as you want to see us - in the simplest terms, in the most convenient definitions. But what we found out is that each one of us is a brain, and an athlete, and a basket case, a princess, and a criminal.
Claire: Sincerely yours, the Breakfast Club.
