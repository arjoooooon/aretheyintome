33,"Not much, just hanging out with friends. What's up with you?

 Nothing much, just thought I'd say hi. What do you like to do for fun?

 I'm more into hiking and photography. I'm not really into comics or video games.

 Oh, I see. Well, that's cool. Do you want to hang out sometime?

 Sorry, I'm not really interested in dating right now.

 Oh, okay. No problem. I just thought we could be friends or something.

 Yeah, sure. We can be friends.

 That's cool. Maybe we could hang out sometime and you could teach me more about hiking and photography.

 Yeah, that sounds like fun.

 Okay, cool. Thanks for being understanding.

 No problem. See you around.
